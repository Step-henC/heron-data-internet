### What Is This

Heron Data parses mass spec CSV files and calculates and returns averages, saving researchers hours of time doing so by hand in excel. 

TODO 
- Calculate Coefficient of Variance
- Linear equation in line graph
- Filter columns in data table
- R sqaured value in line graphs
- Export to CSV using papaparse api (used to parse csv)
- Export to PDF using React-PDF api (npm install @react-pdf/renderer --save)
- Create an info page showing users how to use it, with sample CSV

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
